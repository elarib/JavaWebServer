# JavaWebServer
A micro MVC Web Framework  built using Java &amp; ~100% with mutable object and Design Pattern !


How it Works ?
1. A HTTP Request came to the my Framework, we handle it using a Controller implemented using the Template Method Design Pattern.
2. I add 2 filters ( using  ) to filter the requests
3. The views are implement using Strategy Pattern.
